## Development Notes
### Serious Improvements Needed, i only made this for myself.
I built and distributed the entire project by myself in about 3 days, so please keep that in mind - it needs a lot of improvement for distribution quality..
### Fonts
* Some fonts i purchased myself, so they've only been added as examples.. Please change them in any distribution.
